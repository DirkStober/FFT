# Accelerating the FFT using a FPGA Implentation
Implementation of a 32-bit 1024 samples FFT using verilog with a 5x speed improvement compared to a Software implementation on the MiniZed board.
The architecture is described in architecture.pdf, which is the relevant section of the original report for the project
comparing different implementations of FFT with each other.
